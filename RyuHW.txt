You're absolutely right. I apologize for the oversight. Let's provide the definitions with the same level of explicit detail as before, ensuring we don't forget anything this time.

**Problem: Palindrome Substring Count (Excluding Single Characters) - Explicit Definitions**

**Definitions (Explicitly Explained):**

1.  **String:**
    * **What it is:** A "string" is a sequence of characters, ordered and fixed. Think of it like a train of characters, each one following the next.
    * **How it's used:** It's the input to our function; the text we're analyzing.
    * **Examples:**
        * `"apple"`: A string of lowercase letters.
        * `"123"`: A string of numbers.
        * `"Hello!"`: A string with letters and punctuation.
        * `""`: An empty string (no characters).

2.  **Character:**
    * **What it is:** A "character" is a single unit of text; a letter, number, or symbol.
    * **Case-sensitive:** 'A' and 'a' are different. This matters for palindromes.
    * **Examples:** 'a', 'Z', '9', '!', '$', ' '.

3.  **Substring:**
    * **What it is:** A "substring" is a part of a string, a section of consecutive characters.
    * **How it's formed:** Imagine cutting a piece out of the string, keeping the order intact.
    * **Contiguous:** The characters must be next to each other in the original string.
    * **Examples:**
        * `"ell"` from `"hello"`
        * `"ab"` from `"abcd"`
        * `"a"` from any string containing "a"
    * **Non-Examples:**
        * `"hlo"` from `"hello"` (not consecutive)

4.  **Palindrome:**
    * **What it is:** A string or substring that reads the same backward as forward.
    * **Case-sensitive:** 'Racecar' is a palindrome, 'RaceCar' is not.
    * **Excluding Single Characters:** In this version of the problem, a single character is *not* considered a palindrome.
    * **Examples:**
        * `"madam"`
        * `"12321"`
        * `"aa"`
        * `"abba"`
    * **Non-Examples:**
        * `"RaceCar"`
        * `"abc"`
        * `"a"` (in this version of the problem)

**Task (Explicitly Explained):**

Given a string, your function `countPalindromicSubstrings` must:

1.  **Identify all substrings (excluding single characters):**
    * Find all sequences of 2 or more consecutive characters.

2.  **Determine palindromes:**
    * Check if each substring reads the same forward and backward (case-sensitive).

3.  **Count palindromic substrings:**
    * Keep a count of the substrings that are palindromes.

4.  **Return the count:**
    * Return the total number of palindromic substrings (excluding single characters).

**Rules:**

1.  **Case-Sensitivity:** Palindrome checks are case-sensitive.
2.  **Exclude Single Characters:** Do not count single characters as palindromes.
3.  **Count Overlaps:** Count overlapping palindromes separately.

**Input:**

* A string.

**Output:**

* An integer representing the count of palindromic substrings.

**Examples (With Explicit Explanations of Outputs):**

1.  **Input:** `"abaab"`
    * **Output:** `2`
    * **Explanation:** "aa", "aba"

2.  **Input:** `"racecar"`
    * **Output:** `3`
    * **Explanation:** "racecar", "aca", "cec"

3.  **Input:** `"abc"`
    * **Output:** `0`
    * **Explanation:** No palindromes (excluding single characters).

4.  **Input:** `"aaa"`
    * **Output:** `3`
    * **Explanation:** "aa", "aa", "aaa"

5.  **Input:** `"abba"`
    * **Output:** `2`
    * **Explanation:** "bb", "abba"
